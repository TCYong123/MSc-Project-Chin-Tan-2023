sw_im.py: Crank-Nicholson and Implicit Midpoint methods
sw_trbdf2.py: TR-BDF2 method
sw_convergence.py: calculate L2-norm by reading values from sw_im.py and sw_trbdf2.py, (currently not working as intended)

sw_test.py: File containing IM and TRBDF2 methods to compare their L2-norm directly
sw_conver.py: modified sw_convergence script to use sw_test.py
